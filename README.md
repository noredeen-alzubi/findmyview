# FindMyView JO
## What I'm learning from this project (so far):
- Dependency management is very important. Ignoring warnings and JS related errors that don't initially break functionality will eventually lead to a world of pain. 
- It's very tempting to trust or rely on the Rails 'magic' and assume it will do what it's supposed to do, but knowing what's happening under the hood is critical, especially when it's time to debug. Don't be afraid to dive into the details!
- Ruby is awesome.
